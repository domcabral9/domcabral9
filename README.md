This is Cabral! I'm currently working as a 
Cyber Security Analyst 100% remote. My tech stack includes Linux, Networking Fundamentals, Programming (Bash & Python) and others.

What excites me about Cyber Security is the possibility to work with complex infrastructures, perform code analysis using threat hunting concepts.

In my free time, I like to break some safety protocols in my homelab (then restore them, hardening them), going to the gym, watching Netflix, playing games and spending time with my loved ones.
